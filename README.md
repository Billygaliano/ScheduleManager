Good ways of programming:
--------------------
+ Using design patterns.
+ Document properly all the methods, classes, etc. used.
+ Do not use exceptions in model classes (and persistence). These classes serve only to management and performance feedback.
+ Right tabulation methods, sentences, conditionals, etc.
+ Right vertical spacing between blocks. The code must breathe and easily read, in a very clear way.
+ Language homogeneous throughout the code (because java is implemented in English, use English).
+ Descriptive definition of variables, methods, classes, etc. Preferred is a little longer name than a short descriptive ones without knowing what this refers. Without fear of long names.
